<br><br>
Players assume the role of Mimi, a young girl obsessed with developing high-tech exoskeletons, known as Silhouettes.  When she and her mother stumble upon an online ad for an underground fighting tournament, her mother quickly decides that Mimi must compete (and win) in order to pay off the tremendous debts that her daughter's hobby has incurred.
<br><br>
What follows is a battle between Mimi and six other girls, all of whom don their own robotic combat suits.  The player completes the game after successfully defeating all six opponents, resulting in a scene where Mimi's mother decides that her daughter must now move on to an even bigger tournament with even bigger prize winnings.
